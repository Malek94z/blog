## 📱 Sharing Your Link

Once deployed, you can:
- Add the link to your LinkedIn profile
- Include it in your email signature
- Share it in job applications
- Print it on business cards as a QR code

---

## 🔄 Updating Your Site

### Netlify Drop:
- Just drag the updated folder again to the same site

### GitHub Pages:
- Upload new files to your repository
- Changes appear automatically

### Vercel:
- Push changes to GitHub (if connected)
- Or re-deploy through the dashboard

## ⚠️ Why NOT Google Drive?

Google Drive doesn't serve HTML files as websites. When someone clicks your link, they'll see:
- A download button instead of your website
- The raw HTML code
- Not a functional website

Use the options above for a proper, shareable website! 🚀
